Dear Hiring Manager,<br/>
I am a Mathematical Statistics graduate from the University of Pretoria. I am currently doing a Data Science internship with Standard Bank Group.

I possess the following skills Critical Thinking, Time Management, Basic Programming and Teamwork skills, which I hope to use in the role I will be given at your company.<br/>
Since joining the bank, I have been a part of various projects. Most notable projects that I was a part of are as follows. I build a QNA bot for procurement team. I build a PowerApp that helps users with onboarding to the cloud. I was also apart of various other projects such as knowledge mining, Azure Speech Services and OCR.
